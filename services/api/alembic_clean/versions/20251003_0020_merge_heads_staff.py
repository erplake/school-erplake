"""Merge multiple head revisions into single linear head.

This merge resolves divergence between:
 - 20251003_0000_staff_full_upgrade
 - 20251003_0010_heads_class_settings
 - 20251003_0010_heads_cls_sets

Both 0010_* migrations contain duplicate logic (head_mistress + wing head_id + class storage/meet).
We keep one (20251003_0010_heads_cls_sets) as the canonical prior migration.
If the alternate 0010 file already applied its changes separately in some env, this merge is still safe
because DDL was idempotent or identical.
